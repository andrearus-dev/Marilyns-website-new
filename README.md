# Marilyns-website-new

New and updated website. In the previous one, I had the home page text starting from the left hand side of the page, going across, filling up 3/4 of the page.
I decided that it would look better if I had the text in the middle, with equal space on either side of it. 
I also changed the grid layout making the margin on the sides smaller, and spacing out the columns. 
I had removed the FIND OUT MORE buttons in the Training section, and instead put an underline under the text and changed its' colour, for a cleaner and simpler look. 
When someone hovered over the text, or clicked on it, the colour of the text got lighter, to indicate an action could or was taken.
I had also changed the layout of the other pages, making the margin on the sides smaller, and spacing out the columns. 
For the form validation I used JS, and php for once the person had sent out the email. 

By refactoring my code, I was able to improve the appearance and structure of the website as well as the readibility of my code.
