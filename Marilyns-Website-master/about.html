            <p class="intro-text-others"> Marilyn has developed an extraordinary empathy with the body. She is a health and wellness practitioner and educator, focusing on holistic therapies and traditional aesthetic treatments with over 18 yrs experience providing spa-related services.</p>
                <p class="intro-text-others"> Marilyn has a profound understanding of what makes our bodies “tick”.Marilyn works with her deep knowledge of the inherent intelligence of Mother Nature and our body’s own ability to heal and balance ourselves. She is able to comprehend what is going on in our bodies and incorporates the most effective holistic modalities into a customized therapeutic     treatment to enable our bodies to heal and come back to balance.</p>
                    <p class="intro-text-others"> Holistic health is your overall state of wellness on all levels of your being - Physical, Mental,and Emotional / Spiritual. The word “Holistic” implies condition of the whole. When you affect one level of energy, either positively or negatively, to some extent you affect the whole person.</p>
                        <p class="intro-text-others">Very focused and passionate about sharing her knowledge and years of experience in Holistic Therapies, Marilyn recognizes everyone has their own unique touch and hands of energy to re-fuel others and she encourages future therapists and clients to undertake their own journey in learning. She will inspire you and enlist you in understanding your own body’s needs and give you the knowledge for yourself.</p>
                    <p class="intro-text-others">She is a gifted trainer and instructs in non-intrusive modalities for pro-active health, empowering those interested how to “listen” to and read the signals the body is sending. Sorensen-Graham believes that “listening to the body is an art form we have lost through conventional medicine”, by treating the symptom and not exploring the cause and underlying message our body is trying to communicate. She also believes our body is capable of telling us where we need to correct and re-align for maintaining health and achieve a better sense of wellness.</p>
                <p class="intro-text-others">She first became an esthetician in 1987 while raising three boys. Beginning with Aromatherapy, this was the inspirational turning point which ignited into a full blown passion of Holistic modalities. Driven by her passion Marilyn has developed an impressive array of skills and has undertaken many certification courses and study in the richly diverse arena of natural holistic modalities. The key Certifications acquired by Marilyn are; Aromatherapist (CAHA), Reflexologist, Hot Stone, Indian Head, Reiki and Ayurvedic Practitioner, Axitonal Alignment, Thai Stem and Lava Shell. She is currently instructing 3 Holistic programs for certification; Reflexology, Hot Stone and Indian Head.

             <p class="statement">“Passion is the energy needed; to drive us to knowledge and seek self-awareness, to acquire skills by emulating others, and to share.”</p>
